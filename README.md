# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 970732

Project idea short description:

*In short:*

A website that an "admin" can upload audiofiles (audiobooks) and share specific ones with specific "users". Users can log in and can listen to the audiofiles that were shared with them, the server saves the listening progress, and resumes from the last saved point when switching devices or reopening the webbrowser.

**More detailed & idea**

*why*

I have an extensive library (200+) of audiobooks. Many of those I have bought from "audible" and many more on CD / digitalized on mp3.

Audible synchronizes the progress of each audiobook over every device, this isn't possible with the physically owned ones and there is no real solution out there that allows that. (There is booksonic & plex but both don't save the progress across devices.) In fact there are really not many great solutions to save the current progress even on the local device.
Further I would love to be able to share my audiobooks that I have in audible with my family, which isn't possible, except with account sharing, which brings the problem that I can't listen to the same audiobook as my sister. In essence one can only listen to audiobooks that are already finished, if you don't want to screw up the listening progress.

*detailed*

I want an application where I as an administrator can:

- upload audiobooks
- select users to which share certain audiobooks or authors.

A user upon login:

- sees the most recent audiobook they listened to.
- can browse authors and their books.
- if clicking on an audiobook, the book continues to play from the last saved progress point for that specific user.



I certainly have many more ideas to add to that project such as a metadata crawler over the audible api, to automatically group book series etc. but that would be wide out of scope for that exercise.


## Project confirmation

This is a phantastic idea, in particular because it solves a real problem. You should start with a minimal feature set. If there is time left in the end, you can always add new features later.

I hope uploading and playing the audio is not too complicated. Even though your application is kind of pointless without it, I think you can skip this functionality for the exercise, if it burns too much time. Sounds like you plan to continue with this project after the exercise anyway.

You can start. Good luck!

(The communication and documentation can also be in German, if you prefer.)
