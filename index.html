<h1>LydBook</h1>
<p>The name Lydbook is based on the Norwegian word for audiobook (Lydbok)</p>
<p>In Lydbook the server owner (admin) can upload audiobooks and then listen to them.</p>
<p>LydBook saves the book which one is currently listening to and displays that on the starting page, also the last few
    books that were listen to are displayed there.</p>

<p>The admin can add users and share audiobooks with these users. Lydbook will keep track of the listening progress for
    each audiobook and user.</p>
<h3>Sharing and Tags</h3>
<p>The sharing mechanics is done through tags.</p>
<p>Each audiobook that gets uploaded automatically gets tagged with the tag <b>Audiobook</b> aswell as a tag that
    contains the <b>Author Name</b>, the admin has the option to add custom tags to the audiobook in the edit menu of
    the book.</p>
<p>In the users section the admin can decide which tags are shared with each user. By default every user gets access to
    the tag <b>Audiobook</b></p>
<p>Users will have access to all the books that are associated with tags that they have permission to.</p>

<h3>The audioplayer supports following features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Automatically jump to the last listening possition.</li>
    <li>Playback speed change between 0.5x and 3.5x</li>
    <li>Play and Pause</li>
    <li>Volume change between 0% and 100%</li>
    <li>Jump forward 30 seconds</li>
    <li>Jump back 30 seconds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shortcomings</h3>
<p>Unfortunately there are some technically shortcomings related to mp3 file encoding.</p>
<p>If one wants to be able to skip around in an audiofile the backend must support partial byte range requests. Partial
    byte range requests bring the benefit that the player can download only the part which is needed right now, else the
    whole book would need to be downloaded each time which makes no sense.</p>
<p>However, if an mp3 file is encoded with VBR (Variable bit rate), it is not possible anymore to calculate which bytes
    of the file correspond to which time, because each frame can have a different bit rate. Thus if the first 5 minutes
    are in 192K and we jump 5 minutes forward the player will make a request based on the 192K bit rate, however if
    after the first 5 minutes the bit rate changes to 96K the jump forward would be not a 5 minutes jump but a 10 minute
    jump. </p>
<p>Because of that as of now LydBook only supports CBR (continuous bit rate) encoded mp3 files, because I haven't found
    any good working java mp3 encoding libraries apart from some lame or ffmpeg wrappers, but these would complicate the
    setup significantly.</p>
<p>Also regarding to the encoding problem LydBook supports only audiobooks that are contained in a single mp3 file. I'll
    probably use a lame wrapper or port it to java in the future.</p>
